If you have not taken CSCI E-22 (Formerly CSCI E-119) (Data
Structures) or CSCI E-124 (Data Structures and Algorithms), how do you
meet the prerequisite? Prior Software Programming Experience



If you have not taken CSCI E-124 (Data Structures and Algorithms), do
you have experience implementing many different data structures from
scratch?  If yes, please describe.  If not, how do you meet the
prerequisite?  I've plenty of experience with Data Structures, DDLs, Data Mappings, ETL, Data Transformation, formatting, etc that I've been using in my job.  I'm a Sr. Data Engineer so this should be easy for me to pick it up.


Are you currently working toward a degree in a degree program?  If so,
which program and what degree? Graduate Program in Software Engineering (This is my first class)


Are you taking any other classes concurrently with this one? NOPE


Do you have experience implementing many different data structures
from scratch?  If yes, please describe.  If not, how do you meet the
prerequisite? I've plenty of experience with Data Structures, DDLs, Data Mappings, ETL, Data Transformation, formatting, etc that I've been using in my job.  I'm a Sr. Data Engineer so this should be easy for me to pick it up.  I define various datamarts based on star schema, snow flake schema, third normal form, etc.


Do you have experience using Unix?  Do you have experience programming
using Unix system calls?  If yes, please describe. Yes, I do have good amount of UNIX experience.  Haven't used UNIX system calls but I can pick it up quickly due to good UNIX experience.

Language, C++, or Java? C Language used in the past


What operating systems have you used (e.g. Windows, Mac OS, Linux,
iOS, Android, etc.)? Windows, Linux, AIX, HP-UX


What computers have you used (i.e., which machine language instruction
sets)? Worked as a Programmer and used Mainframe, AS-400, Ultra Spark Servers, Linux Servers for code development, testing and implementation.


What is your motivation for taking this course? Get command over C langague, Compiler Design and Semantic Processes, Converting HLL to LLL, Parser, etc.
